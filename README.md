# Predict-the-purpose-of-a-trip
In this project I try to predict the purpose of a trip utilising a Random Forest

At this project I analyze the movement trajectories of a real, but anonymized dataset of different commuters using Machine Learning.

Activities to be prediced.

• Work
• Home
• Leisure
• Errand
• Wait

The provided data sets contain the following fields:

• id
• purpose_validated
• dur_in_sec
• hour_start
• hour_end
• day_of_month
• week
• dist_gtfsstops_all
• dist_gtfsstops_train
• dist_gtfsstops_tram
• dist_gtfsstops_bus
• day

This project is the result of an assignment, during the course GIS III, at ETH Zurich.

<h5>Unfortunatelly, I haven't received yet the approval from ETH about publishing the data I used to build this project.</h5>
